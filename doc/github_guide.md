# Basic Github Guide

## What is Github?

Github is a free version control system and software development solution aimed at open source projects and small,
side projects.

It uses the open source version control system *git,* but can still be accessed with other version control systems.
It hosts the files on their servers, so, while we have copies to work on, we can easily share changes we've made
to other team members.  As a software development solution, they've added a few features to supplement *git*.  The
result makes for a pretty easy to use system.

## I don't know what git is...

No worries!  I find git by itself a pain to work with.  If I'm on my laptop, I use one of the many git gui's available
because I actually think everyone hates using git on the command line.  If I'm on my desktop, I use the actual github
download program to deal with it.  I haven't used the windows download in a long time, but the last I did use it, the
program was pretty easy to use, once you understand git and github.

## I still don't know how this works, Mason...

Don't be intimidated by it like I was when I learned about it.  The easiest thing to do, and what Github does to collaborate,
is to, your local machine, create a branch (over simplification: a copy of all the files) from the master branch and name it something meaningful.  Then, switch
to that branch in your github
